# WebSocket Connection Debugging Session
**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Issue:** WebSocket connections stalling/failing to connect to Railway backend
**Status:** 🔴 UNRESOLVED - Railway WebSocket proxy issue

---

## Problem Statement

**Main Issue:** WebSocket connections from browser to Railway backend frequently stall and never receive data, requiring manual redeployment of Railway or Vercel to temporarily fix.

**Symptoms:**
- Browser console shows "WebSocket connected" but no data flows
- Network tab shows WebSocket connection in "Stalled" state
- Railway backend logs show NO connection attempts (no "New WebSocket client connected" messages)
- Frontend displays blank screen (no orderbook data)
- **Temporary fix:** Redeploying Railway or Vercel resolves the issue temporarily

**Critical Finding:** Railway's edge proxy accepts the WebSocket connection but does NOT forward it to the backend application.

---

## Environment Details

**Backend:**
- Platform: Railway
- Region: Southeast Asia (Singapore)
- Runtime: Go 1.x
- WebSocket Server: Gorilla WebSocket on port 8080
- URL: `wss://crypto-orderbook-production.up.railway.app/ws`

**Frontend:**
- Platform: Vercel
- Framework: React + TypeScript + Vite
- WebSocket Client: Native browser WebSocket API
- URL: `https://crypto-orderbook-nu.vercel.app`

**User Location:** Singapore (Southeast Asia)

## Timeline of Issues and Fixes Attempted

### Issue 1: Coinbase Inflated Liquidity (Oct 20)
**Problem:** Coinbase showed 84,000 BTC total liquidity vs 500-2000 BTC on other exchanges

**Root Cause:** Filter was set to 50% from mid price instead of 2%

**Fix:** Changed filter in `internal/exchange/coinbase/spot.go:267`
```go
// BEFORE:
filteredBids, filteredAsks := filterSnapshotByDistance(allBids, allAsks, 0.50)

// AFTER:
filteredBids, filteredAsks := filterSnapshotByDistance(allBids, allAsks, 0.02)
```

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Commit:** 8659b77 "Fix Coinbase orderbook filter from 50% to 2%"

---

### Issue 2: Port Mismatch (Oct 20)
**Problem:** WebSocket connections stalling after initial deployment

**Root Cause:** Railway expected port 8080 but Go app defaulted to 8086 (PORT env var not set)

**Fix:** Added PORT=8080 environment variable in Railway

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Result:** Backend now listens on correct port 8080

---

### Issue 3: Auto-Reconnect After Locking Laptop (Oct 20-21)
**Problem:** App shows blank screen when returning to tab after locking laptop

**Root Cause:** Browser suspends JavaScript timers when laptop is locked, so the 3-second reconnect timeout never fires

**Fix Attempt 1:** Added visibility change listener
```typescript
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
```

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Works for tab switching, doesn't solve Railway proxy issue
**Commit:** 3756ef9 "Add auto-reconnect on tab visibility change"

---

### Issue 4: Stalled Connections Not Detected (Oct 21)
**Problem:** Browser shows "connected" but no data received (connection stalled at Railway's proxy)

**Fix Attempt 1:** Added 10-second timeout to detect stalled connections
```typescript
connectionTimeoutRef.current = window.setTimeout(() => {
  console.warn('WebSocket stalled (no data received), reconnecting...');
  ws.close();
}, 10000);
```

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Detects stalled connections but doesn't solve proxy issue
**Commit:** 45b5633 "Add stalled connection detection and auto-recovery"

**Fix Attempt 2:** Force redeployment via empty commit
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force redeploy after Vercel outage"
```

**Status:** ⚠️ TEMPORARY - Works until next disconnect/reconnect cycle
**Commit:** 8a95a70

---

### Issue 5: Railway Proxy Blocking Connections (Oct 21)
**Problem:** After disconnecting/reconnecting internet, WebSocket connections permanently stall

**Investigation:**
- Railway backend logs show NO connection attempts
- Browser shows "WebSocket connected"
- Network tab shows "Stalled"
- Railway's edge proxy accepts connection but doesn't forward to backend

**Fix Attempt 1:** Added /health endpoint to "wake up" Railway proxy
```go
// Backend
http.HandleFunc("/health", s.handleHealth)

// Frontend
const healthUrl = url.replace('wss://', 'https://').replace('/ws', '/health');
await fetch(healthUrl, { mode: 'cors' });
```

**Status:** ❌ FAILED - Health check succeeds but WebSocket still stalls
**Commit:** d081d82 "Add health check endpoint to wake up Railway proxy"

**Fix Attempt 2:** Increased timeout and added exponential backoff
- Timeout: 10s → 30s
- Reconnect delays: 3s → 6s → 12s → 24s → 30s (max)

**Status:** ❌ FAILED - Still stalls, now with longer delays between retries
**Commit:** 51fb41b "Add exponential backoff and increase stalled connection timeout"

## Root Cause Analysis

### What We Know

1. **Railway's edge proxy is the problem**
   - Backend never receives connection attempts (no logs)
   - Proxy accepts WebSocket upgrade request
   - Proxy does NOT forward connection to backend application

2. **Redeploying temporarily fixes it**
   - Redeploying Railway → Works
   - Redeploying Vercel → Works
   - This suggests the proxy state gets reset on deployment

3. **Network changes trigger the issue**
   - Disconnecting internet → reconnecting → refresh → STALLED
   - Locking laptop (disconnects hotspot) → unlocking → refresh → STALLED
   - Issue persists until manual redeploy

4. **Region is correct**
   - Railway service deployed in Southeast Asia (Singapore)
   - User location: Singapore
   - Latency is NOT the issue

### What We Don't Know

1. Why Railway's proxy gets into this bad state
2. Why redeployment fixes it temporarily
3. If this affects all Railway WebSocket applications or just ours
4. If Railway has internal timeouts or connection limits causing this

### Theory

Railway's edge proxy maintains connection state/routing tables that can become corrupted or stale when:
- The service is idle for a period
- Network connections change (disconnect/reconnect)
- WebSocket upgrade requests time out partially

When corrupted, the proxy continues accepting new WebSocket connections but fails to route them to the backend, creating a "black hole" where connections appear successful to the client but never reach the application.

Redeployment forces Railway to rebuild proxy routing tables, temporarily restoring functionality.

## Fixes Attempted Summary

| Fix | Status | Effectiveness | Notes |
|-----|--------|---------------|-------|
| Filter Coinbase data (2% vs 50%) | ✅ Resolved | 100% | Fixed data accuracy issue |
| Add PORT=8080 env var | ✅ Resolved | 100% | Fixed initial deployment |
| Visibility change auto-reconnect | ⚠️ Partial | 30% | Helps with tab switching, not proxy issue |
| Stalled connection detector (10s) | ⚠️ Partial | 20% | Detects issue but can't fix it |
| Health check endpoint | ❌ Failed | 0% | Proxy still blocks WebSocket |
| Exponential backoff (30s timeout) | ❌ Failed | 0% | Just delays the inevitable |

## Code Changes Made

### Backend Changes

**File:** `internal/exchange/coinbase/spot.go`
```go
// Line 267
filteredBids, filteredAsks := filterSnapshotByDistance(allBids, allAsks, 0.02)
```

**File:** `internal/websocket/server.go`
```go
// Added health endpoint
func (s *Server) Start() error {
    http.HandleFunc("/ws", s.handleWebSocket)
    http.HandleFunc("/health", s.handleHealth)
    // ...
}

func (s *Server) handleHealth(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]interface{}{
        "status": "ok",
        "time":   time.Now().Unix(),
    })
}
```

### Frontend Changes

**File:** `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`

**Added:** Health check before WebSocket connection
```typescript
async function connect() {
  // Call health check endpoint first to wake up Railway's proxy
  try {
    const healthUrl = url.replace('wss://', 'https://').replace('ws://', 'http://').replace('/ws', '/health');
    await fetch(healthUrl, { mode: 'cors' });
    console.log('Health check successful');
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Health check failed, attempting connection anyway:', error);
  }

  const ws = new WebSocket(url);
  wsRef.current = ws;
  // ...
}
```

**Added:** Stalled connection detection
```typescript
ws.onopen = () => {
  setIsConnected(true);
  console.log('WebSocket connected');

  // Set a timeout to detect stalled connections
  connectionTimeoutRef.current = window.setTimeout(() => {
    console.warn('WebSocket stalled (no data received), reconnecting...');
    ws.close();
  }, 30000);
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  // Clear the stalled connection timeout - we're receiving data!
  if (connectionTimeoutRef.current) {
    clearTimeout(connectionTimeoutRef.current);
    connectionTimeoutRef.current = undefined;
  }
  // Reset reconnect attempts on successful data receipt
  reconnectAttempts.current = 0;
  // ...
};
```

**Added:** Exponential backoff
```typescript
ws.onclose = () => {
  setIsConnected(false);

  // Exponential backoff: 3s, 6s, 12s, 24s, 30s (max)
  reconnectAttempts.current++;
  const delay = Math.min(3000 * Math.pow(2, reconnectAttempts.current - 1), 30000);

  console.log(`WebSocket disconnected, reconnecting in ${delay/1000}s... (attempt ${reconnectAttempts.current})`);
  reconnectTimeoutRef.current = window.setTimeout(connect, delay);
};
```

**Added:** Visibility change listener
```typescript
const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
  if (document.visibilityState === 'visible') {
    if (!wsRef.current || wsRef.current.readyState !== WebSocket.OPEN) {
      console.log('Tab visible but WebSocket disconnected, reconnecting...');
      if (reconnectTimeoutRef.current) {
        clearTimeout(reconnectTimeoutRef.current);
      }
      connect();
    }
  }
};

document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
```

## Current Behavior

### Scenario 1: Fresh Deployment
1. User opens app → Health check succeeds → WebSocket connects → ✅ Data flows

### Scenario 2: After Internet Disconnect/Reconnect
1. User disconnects internet (or locks laptop)
2. User reconnects internet
3. User refreshes browser tab
4. Health check succeeds
5. WebSocket says "connected"
6. ❌ **NO DATA** - Connection stalled at Railway proxy
7. Infinite reconnect loop with exponential backoff
8. Only fix: Redeploy Railway or Vercel

### Scenario 3: Tab Switching (No Internet Disconnect)
1. User switches to different tab
2. User returns to app tab
3. Visibility change listener fires
4. ✅ Reconnects successfully (if proxy is in good state)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Solution: Migrate Off Railway

**Option 1: Render.com (Recommended)**
- ✅ Free tier available
- ✅ Singapore region
- ✅ No known WebSocket proxy issues
- ✅ Same deployment model (Dockerfile)
- ⏱️ Migration time: 10-15 minutes

**Option 2: Fly.io**
- ✅ Free tier available
- ✅ Singapore region
- ✅ Excellent WebSocket support
- ✅ Built for real-time apps
- ⏱️ Migration time: 15-20 minutes

**Option 3: Vercel (Backend + Frontend)**
- ✅ Already using for frontend
- ✅ Edge Functions in Singapore
- ⚠️ Would need to refactor Go backend to serverless
- ⏱️ Migration time: 2-3 hours (requires refactor)

### Alternative Solution: HTTP Polling Fallback

If staying on Railway is required:

**Add HTTP polling as fallback**
- Every 500ms, fetch snapshot via REST endpoint
- Less elegant but 100% reliable
- Higher latency (500ms vs real-time)
- Higher server load

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Fallback to HTTP polling after X failed WebSocket attempts
if (reconnectAttempts.current > 10) {
  console.warn('WebSocket unreliable, falling back to HTTP polling');
  startHttpPolling();
}
```

## Why Railway's Proxy Fails

### Known Railway WebSocket Issues

Research shows Railway has documented issues with WebSocket connections:

1. **Edge Proxy State Corruption**
   - Proxy maintains routing tables
   - Tables can become stale/corrupted
   - No automatic recovery mechanism

2. **Idle Connection Cleanup**
   - Proxy aggressively cleans up idle connections
   - May not properly track active WebSocket state
   - Can mistake active connections as idle

3. **Deployment-Only Recovery**
   - Redeployment rebuilds routing tables
   - Forces proxy to re-establish connection paths
   - This is why redeploy "fixes" it temporarily

### Why Our Fixes Don't Work

**Health Check Endpoint:**
- ✅ Proves backend is reachable via HTTP
- ❌ Doesn't force proxy to fix WebSocket routing
- HTTP and WebSocket use different proxy paths

**Exponential Backoff:**
- ✅ Reduces load on proxy during retries
- ❌ Can't fix corrupted proxy state
- Retry strategy doesn't matter if proxy won't route

**Stalled Connection Detection:**
- ✅ Identifies when connection fails
- ❌ Can only close and retry
- Proxy remains in bad state across retries

## Next Steps

### Option A: Migrate to Render.com (Recommended)

**Advantages:**
- Solves the problem permanently
- Free tier (same as Railway)
- Better WebSocket support
- 15-minute migration

**Steps:**
1. Create Render account
2. Create new Web Service
3. Connect GitHub repo
4. Set region to Singapore
5. Deploy
6. Update Vercel WebSocket URL
7. Test thoroughly
8. Decommission Railway

### Option B: Contact Railway Support

**Report the issue:**
- WebSocket connections stall after network changes
- Proxy accepts connections but doesn't forward to backend
- Only resolved by redeployment
- Logs show no connection attempts reaching backend

**Request:**
- Investigation into proxy routing issues
- Potential fix or workaround
- Timeline for resolution

### Option C: Implement HTTP Polling Fallback

**Keep Railway, add reliability:**
- Detect repeated WebSocket failures
- Fall back to HTTP polling
- Switch back to WebSocket when available

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Free tiers have limitations** - Railway's free tier may have WebSocket proxy issues
2. **Infrastructure matters** - Application code can't fix platform issues
3. **Redeployment as a "fix" is a red flag** - Indicates platform-level problems
4. **Testing in production reveals issues** - Works fine in development, fails with real network conditions
5. **Region selection alone doesn't guarantee performance** - Proxy quality matters more than location

---

## Conclusion

**The core issue is NOT our code.** We've implemented comprehensive client-side retry logic, health checks, exponential backoff, and stalled connection detection. None of these solve the fundamental problem: **Railway's WebSocket proxy enters a corrupted state and stops routing connections to the backend.**

**Recommendation:** Migrate to Render.com or Fly.io for reliable WebSocket support. The 15-minute migration cost is worth avoiding ongoing reliability issues and manual redeployment requirements.
