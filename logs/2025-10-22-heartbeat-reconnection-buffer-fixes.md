# Session Log: Heartbeat, Reconnection, and Buffer Size Fixes
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Session Focus:** Implementing connection stability improvements for Kraken, Coinbase, and BingX exchanges

---

## Overview
This session focused on fixing WebSocket connection stability issues across three exchanges (Kraken, Coinbase, BingX) and addressing buffer overflow warnings by increasing buffer sizes for all exchanges.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Kraken Connection Drops
- **Problem:** Kraken WebSocket connections were dropping after 10-15 minutes
- **Root Cause:** Lack of ping/pong heartbeat mechanism
- **Solution:** Implemented active ping/pong with 30-second intervals

### 2. Coinbase Zombie Connections
- **Problem:** Coinbase connections would stop receiving data but appear connected
- **Root Cause:** Not monitoring Coinbase's automatic heartbeats
- **Solution:** Implemented heartbeat monitoring (60s timeout) with reconnection

### 3. BingX Connection Stability
- **Problem:** BingX connections were unstable in production
- **Root Cause:** Not monitoring server pings
- **Solution:** Implemented server ping monitoring with reconnection logic

### 4. Buffer Overflow Warnings
- **Problem:** Render logs showed "[kraken] Warning: update channel full, skipping update"
- **Root Cause:** High-volume exchanges (Kraken sends 100+ updates/sec) overwhelm 1000-buffer capacity
- **Solution:** Increased all exchange buffers from 1000 to 5000

## Work Completed

### Phase 1: Kraken Heartbeat & Reconnection
**Commit:** 2604621

#### Files Modified:
- `internal/exchange/kraken/spot.go`
- `internal/exchange/kraken/types.go`

#### Changes:
1. **Added to SpotExchange struct:**
   - `wsConnMu sync.Mutex` - Thread-safe WebSocket operations
   - `reconnecting atomic.Bool` - Prevents concurrent reconnection attempts

2. **Implemented pingLoop() method:**
   ```go
   // Sends ping every 30 seconds
   // Monitors connection health
   // Triggers reconnection on errors
   ```

3. **Implemented reconnect() method:**
   - Exponential backoff: 5s → 10s → 15s → 20s → 25s → 30s (max)
   - Maximum 10 attempts
   - Resets snapshot state after successful reconnection
   - Thread-safe connection management

4. **Updated readMessages():**
   - Handles pong responses
   - Triggers reconnection on WebSocket read errors
   - Thread-safe connection access

5. **Updated Close():**
   - Proper channel cleanup
   - Prevents multiple close attempts

6. **Added message types:**
   - `PingRequest`
   - `PongResponse`
   - `HeartbeatMessage`

#### Testing:
- Tested locally with `go run ./cmd/main.go 2>&1 | grep -E "(kraken|Kraken|ping|pong|reconnect)"`
- No ping errors observed
- Connection remained stable

---

### Phase 2: Buffer Size Increase (All Exchanges)
**Commit:** 2ddaf2e

#### Rationale:
- Kraken sends 100+ orderbook updates per second
- 1000-buffer = 10 seconds of capacity at high volume
- 5000-buffer = 50 seconds of capacity
- Memory impact: ~9MB total (negligible with 4GB RAM)
- User upgraded Render instance to 2 CPU 4GB

#### Files Modified:
1. `internal/exchange/binance/spot.go`
2. `internal/exchange/binance/futures.go`
3. `internal/exchange/bybit/spot.go`
4. `internal/exchange/bybit/futures.go`
5. `internal/exchange/okx/spot.go`
6. `internal/exchange/asterdex/futures.go`
7. `internal/exchange/coinbase/spot.go`
8. `internal/exchange/bingx/spot.go`
9. `internal/exchange/kraken/spot.go`

#### Change Pattern:
```go
// Before
updateChan: make(chan *exchange.DepthUpdate, 1000),

// After
updateChan: make(chan *exchange.DepthUpdate, 5000),
```

### Phase 3: Coinbase Heartbeat & Reconnection
**Commit:** 48134c5

#### Files Modified:
- `internal/exchange/coinbase/spot.go`
- `internal/exchange/coinbase/types.go`

#### Changes:
1. **Added to SpotExchange struct:**
   - `wsConnMu sync.Mutex` - Thread-safe WebSocket operations
   - `reconnecting atomic.Bool` - Prevents concurrent reconnection attempts

2. **Updated readMessages():**
   - Detects and parses heartbeat messages
   - Triggers reconnection on WebSocket errors
   - Thread-safe connection access
   ```go
   var heartbeat HeartbeatMessage
   if err := json.Unmarshal(message, &heartbeat); err == nil && heartbeat.Channel == "heartbeats" {
       e.updateLastPing()
       continue
   }
   ```

3. **Implemented pingLoop():**
   - Monitors Coinbase's automatic heartbeats (Coinbase sends them, we don't need to send pings)
   - Detects stale connections (no heartbeat for 60s)
   - Triggers reconnection on timeout

4. **Implemented reconnect() method:**
   - Same pattern as Kraken
   - Exponential backoff (5s → 30s max)
   - Maximum 10 attempts
   - Resets snapshot state

5. **Updated Close():**
   - Proper channel cleanup
   - Closes done signal before WebSocket
   - Closes updateChan after all goroutines stopped

6. **Added HeartbeatMessage type:**
   ```go
   type HeartbeatMessage struct {
       Channel        string `json:"channel"`
       ClientID       string `json:"client_id"`
       Timestamp      string `json:"timestamp"`
       SequenceNum    int64  `json:"sequence_num"`
       CurrentTime    string `json:"current_time"`
       HeartbeatCount int64  `json:"heartbeat_counter"`
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: BingX Heartbeat & Reconnection
**Commit:** f7d326c

#### Files Modified:
- `internal/exchange/bingx/spot.go`
- `internal/exchange/bingx/types.go`

#### Changes:
1. **Added to SpotExchange struct:**
   - `wsConnMu sync.Mutex` - Thread-safe WebSocket operations
   - `reconnecting atomic.Bool` - Prevents concurrent reconnection attempts

2. **Updated pingLoop():**
   - Monitors server pings from BingX (BingX sends pings, we respond with pong in handleMessage)
   - Detects stale connections (no ping for 60s)
   - Triggers reconnection on timeout
   ```go
   health := e.Health()
   if !health.LastPing.IsZero() && time.Since(health.LastPing) > 60*time.Second {
       log.Printf("[%s] No ping from server for 60s, connection may be stale", e.GetName())
       go e.reconnect()
       return
   }
   ```

3. **Implemented reconnect() method:**
   - Same pattern as Kraken and Coinbase
   - Exponential backoff (5s → 30s max)
   - Maximum 10 attempts
   - Resets snapshot state
   - Recreates snapshotReady channel

4. **Updated readMessages():**
   - Thread-safe connection access with mutex
   - Checks if connection is nil before reading
   - Triggers reconnection on WebSocket errors
   ```go
   e.wsConnMu.Lock()
   conn := e.wsConn
   e.wsConnMu.Unlock()

   if conn == nil {
       log.Printf("[%s] Connection is nil, triggering reconnection", e.GetName())
       go e.reconnect()
       return
   }
   ```

5. **Updated Close():**
   - Moved done channel close outside wsConn check
   - Proper cleanup order: done → write close message → close connection → close updateChan

6. **Added message types:**
   - `PingMessage` (from BingX server)
   - `PongMessage` (our response)

---

## Technical Patterns Used

### Thread-Safe WebSocket Operations
```go
// Protect concurrent writes with mutex
e.wsConnMu.Lock()
conn := e.wsConn
e.wsConnMu.Unlock()

if conn == nil {
    // Handle nil connection
    return
}

// Use local conn variable to avoid race conditions
err := conn.WriteJSON(msg)
```

### Atomic Reconnection Flag
```go
// Prevent multiple simultaneous reconnection attempts
if !e.reconnecting.CompareAndSwap(false, true) {
    log.Printf("[%s] Reconnection already in progress, skipping", e.GetName())
    return
}
defer e.reconnecting.Store(false)
```

### Exponential Backoff
```go
backoff := time.Duration(attempt) * 5 * time.Second
if backoff > 30*time.Second {
    backoff = 30 * time.Second
}
time.Sleep(backoff)
```

### Graceful Shutdown
```go
// 1. Cancel context
if e.cancel != nil {
    e.cancel()
}

// 2. Close done channel
select {
case <-e.done:
default:
    close(e.done)
}

// 3. Close WebSocket connection
if e.wsConn != nil {
    e.wsConn.WriteMessage(websocket.CloseMessage, ...)
    e.wsConn.Close()
}

// 4. Close update channel (after all goroutines stopped)
close(e.updateChan)
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Different Heartbeat Patterns?

1. **Kraken:** Active ping/pong
   - We send ping every 30s
   - Kraken responds with pong
   - Pattern: Client-initiated

2. **Coinbase:** Passive heartbeat monitoring
   - Coinbase sends automatic heartbeats
   - We monitor LastPing timestamp
   - Pattern: Server-initiated, client monitors

3. **BingX:** Server ping monitoring
   - BingX sends pings to us
   - We respond with pong in handleMessage()
   - We monitor LastPing timestamp
   - Pattern: Server-initiated, client responds and monitors

### Why Not Just Increase Timeouts?
- Timeouts don't fix zombie connections
- Dead connections don't generate errors
- Active monitoring detects stale connections
- Automatic reconnection restores service

### Why Exponential Backoff?
- Prevents overwhelming server during outages
- Gives network time to recover
- Reduces log spam
- Industry best practice

## Memory Impact Analysis

### Buffer Size Increase
```
Before: 9 exchanges × 1000 updates × ~1KB = ~9MB
After:  9 exchanges × 5000 updates × ~1KB = ~45MB

Actual impact: ~36MB additional memory
Available: 4GB RAM on Render instance
Utilization: <1% of available memory
```

### Goroutine Overhead
Each exchange now runs:
- 1 × readMessages() goroutine
- 1 × pingLoop() goroutine
- 0-1 × reconnect() goroutine (only when reconnecting)

Total: ~18-27 goroutines (was ~9 before)
Memory impact: ~2-4MB (Go goroutines are lightweight)

## Next Steps

### Monitoring (Render Logs)
1. Watch for reconnection messages
2. Verify no "websocket: close 1006" errors
3. Check for reduced/eliminated "update channel full" warnings
4. Monitor all exchanges for 15+ minutes of stable operation

### If Issues Persist
1. Check Render logs for specific error patterns
2. Verify reconnection attempts are successful
3. Monitor memory usage on Render dashboard
4. Consider adding more detailed logging

### Future Improvements
1. Add metrics/telemetry for reconnection counts
2. Implement circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
3. Add configurable timeouts and retry counts
4. Consider WebSocket compression for bandwidth

## Key Learnings

1. **Zombie Connections Are Real:** Dead connections don't always generate errors
2. **Each Exchange Is Different:** Different heartbeat patterns required
3. **Buffer Size Matters:** High-volume exchanges need larger buffers
4. **Thread Safety Is Critical:** WebSocket concurrent writes cause panics
5. **Atomic Operations Prevent Races:** Multiple goroutines need coordination
6. **Proper Cleanup Order Matters:** Channels must close in correct sequence
